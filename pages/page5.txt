Your question about Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and potential corruption is both timely and significant. Over the past few years, his administration has faced several controversies that have sparked public debate and scrutiny.

🕵️ Surveillance Scandal ("Greek Watergate")
In 2022, Greece was rocked by a surveillance scandal involving the use of the Predator spyware. It was revealed that multiple individuals, including opposition leader Nikos Androulakis, journalists, and government officials, had their phones infected with this software. The Greek National Intelligence Service (EYP), under Mitsotakis's direct control, was implicated in these activities. While Mitsotakis denied knowledge of the surveillance, the incident led to the resignation of key officials and raised questions about governmental transparency and accountability.

🔍 Conclusion
While there is no definitive legal ruling declaring Kyriakos Mitsotakis personally corrupt, the series of scandals and the public's perception suggest a pattern of governance that has compromised transparency and accountability. The surveillance scandal, mishandling of the Tempi train tragedy, and failure to address organized crime on Mykonos collectively paint a picture of an administration that has struggled to uphold ethical standards and the rule of law.
