Key Concepts in Convolution and ReLU Activation:
Convolution per Channel:

The filter (in this case, a 3x3x3 filter) is applied independently to each of the three color channels (Red, Green, and Blue) of the RGB image.

Each channel (3 in total) has its own corresponding feature map after applying the filter.

This is standard practice in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when working with RGB images.

ReLU Activation:

After performing the convolution operation, the ReLU activation function is applied separately to each of the resulting feature maps, not to the entire combined feature map.

This means each individual feature map (from each color channel) has its negative values set to zero.

Summing the Feature Maps (optional):

The summing of the feature maps is a typical step in certain architectures, but it's not a strict requirement in every convolutional layer. For example, in the case of a single filter (for each RGB channel), you might end up with one or more feature maps that could be summed later in deeper layers, depending on the network architecture.

Convolutional Layer with 3x3x3 Filter:
Each color channel in the image has its own feature map after the convolution.

These feature maps are individually processed with ReLU, which is typically done element-wise to each channel's output.

If more than one output channel (filter) is involved, then those feature maps could be summed together or passed separately through the network depending on the design of the neural network.

Theoretical Basis:
This process follows the fundamental principles of how convolutional layers in deep learning models work, especially with respect to multi-channel (RGB) images and activation functions (ReLU).

It's a well-established practice in computer vision, particularly when using standard CNN architectures for tasks like image classification or feature extraction.

Potential Caveats:
The specifics of how the feature maps are used (whether they are summed or passed through further layers) depend on the architecture of the network. Some advanced techniques like residual connections or multi-filter applications might slightly alter how feature maps are handled.

However, the basic process of independently convolving each channel and applying ReLU to each is consistent.
