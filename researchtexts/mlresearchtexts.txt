### Convolution with 3x3x3 Filter and ReLU Activation for RGB Image

1. **Convolution per Channel**:
   - Each of the three channels (Red, Green, and Blue) in the image is convolved with the filter independently. 
   - So, if your filter is \( 3 \times 3 \times 3 \), you will apply the filter to the three channels (one for each of the RGB channels). This results in three separate convolutions, each producing a single 2D output matrix.
   
   - **Example**: If you have an image of size \( H \times W \times 3 \), after applying the convolution, you would get three separate feature maps (one for each of the RGB channels), each of size \( (H-2) \times (W-2) \) (assuming stride = 1 and no padding).

2. **ReLU Activation**:
   - After the convolution, the output of each channel is passed through the **ReLU activation function independently**.
   - So, for each of the three feature maps (one per channel), ReLU is applied to each element in the feature map:
     \[
     \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
     \]
     Any negative values are set to zero.

3. **Summing the Feature Maps** (optional step):
   - After the individual convolutions and ReLU activations are applied to each channel, you may sum the three feature maps together to form a final output feature map. This summing is optional and depends on how the model architecture is designed. In many cases, if you're dealing with multi-channel filters (e.g., a filter with more than 1 output channel), you'd sum them up to create a combined output map.
   
   - This summed feature map is then passed through further layers of the network (e.g., pooling, additional convolutions, etc.).

### To Summarize:
- **Convolution happens per channel** (RGB), meaning the filter is applied separately to the Red, Green, and Blue channels.
- **ReLU activation happens per channel** as well. Each of the three resulting feature maps (one per RGB channel) is activated independently by the ReLU function.
- The feature maps can be **summed** together afterward, but this step depends on your architecture and what you're trying to achieve with the network.
